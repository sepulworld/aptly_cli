[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/sepulworld/aptly_cli/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/sepulworld/aptly_cli?branch=master)

A command line interface to execute [Aptly](http://aptly.info) commands againts remote Aptly API servers.  Aptly-cli will allow you to interact with the file, repo, snapshot, publish, packages, graph and version API endpoints of your Aptly server.


## Installation

### Install Gem:

    $ gem install aptly_cli

or...

### Install and run aptly-cli from Docker:

    # Optional: If you don't pull explicitly, `docker run` will do it for you
    $ docker pull sepulworld/aptly-cli

    $ alias aptly-cli='\
      docker run \
        -v /etc/aptly-cli.conf:/etc/aptly-cli.conf \
        -it --rm --name=aptly-cli \
        sepulworld/aptly-cli'

(Depending on how your system is set up, you might have to add `sudo` in front of the above `docker` commands or add your user to the `docker` group).

If you don't do the `docker pull`, the first time you run `aptly-cli`, the `docker run` command will automatically pull [the `sepulworld/aptly-cli` image on the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sepulworld/aptly-cli/). Subsequent runs will use a locally cached copy of the image and will not have to download anything.

Create a configuration file with aptly server and port, `/etc/aptly-cli.conf` (YAML syntax):

```yaml
---
:proto: http
:server: 127.0.0.1
:port: 8082
:debug: false
```

If you use Basic Authentication to protect your API, add username and password:

```yaml
:username: api-user
:password: api-password
```

The username and password can also be configured for prompt entry using
the following in `aptly-cli.conf`:

```yaml
:username: ${PROMPT}
:password: ${PROMPT_PASSWORD}
```

The tool will prompt for the specified values, where `${PROMPT}` results
in a regular prompt and `${PROMPT_PASSWORD}` results in a password
prompt where the input is replaced by asterisks, e.g.:

    $ aptly-cli version
      Enter a value for username:
      zane
      Enter a value for password:
      ********

Another possibility for storing passwords is `${KEYRING}`. To use this feature,
you must have the [`keyring` gem](https://github.com/jheiss/keyring) installed
and also have a system that is set up to use one of the backends that the
`keyring` gem supports, such as Mac OS X Keychain or GNOME 2 Keyring (Note:
Only Mac OS X Keychain has been tested thus far):

    $ gem install keyring

Then you can put something like this in `aptly-cli.conf`:

```yaml
:username: zane
:password: ${KEYRING}
```

The first time you run an `aptly-cli` command, you will be prompted to enter a
password.

    $ aptly-cli version
    Enter a value for password:
    ***************

The entered password will be stored in your keyring so that future uses of
`aptly-cli` can get the password from your keyring:

    $ aptly-cli version
    {"Version"=>"0.9.7"}

Also make sure that your config file isn't world readable (```chmod o-rw /etc/aptly-cli.conf```)

If a configuration file is not found, the defaults in the example
configuration file above will be used.

## Usage - available aptly-cli commands

The `--config` (`-c`) option allows specifying an alternative config file, e.g.:

    $ aptly-cli -c ~/.config/aptly-cli/aptly-cli.conf repo_list

The `--server`, `--username`, and `--password` options allow specifying
those things on the command-line and not even requiring a config file.

    $ aptly-cli --server 10.3.0.46 --username marca --password '${PROMPT_PASSWORD}' repo_list

Note that you can use `${PROMPT}`, `${PROMPT_PASSWORD}`, and `${KEYRING}` in
the values of these options, just as you can in a config file. Note that you
might have to quote them to prevent the shell from trying to expand them.
